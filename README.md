# PARC
Python Asteroid Rendezvous Code

PARC implements the orbital rendezvous methods from Taylor et al. 2021 (in-prep) in Python 3.10. 

Installation: Instead of a full install, PARC is simple enough that it is easier to simply place the parc directory in the same working directory as any Python script that calls PARC functions. 

Use: Example.py demonstrates the use of PARC for downloading the MPCORB database and computing Earth (LEO) to asteroid delta-v's for a fixed launch date and time of flight for the first 10 objects in the MPCORB database.
